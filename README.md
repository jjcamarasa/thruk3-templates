# thruk3-templates
Modified templates for a better visual experience

## Information
This template rearranges html page objects like service/host info.
It has been created trying not to modify too much the default Light/Dark themes (only added a few tailwind basic classes)
I have tried to change as many fontawesome icons to uniicons counterpart.

## How to test/put it
Put in etc/thruk/templates (wherever it is), and restart thruk service or wait for this service to reload templates.
Add additional css classes to the end of the theme you ar using at path: etc/thruk/themes/themes-available/stylesheets

## Disclaimer
I'm not a frontend developer, I have tested it in virtual environment, when it looks ok, I made backups and put it in production.
I'm not responsible for any damage made to your environment (what could be go really bad? It's only css and html)
If you have any idea or suggestion, make it, fork this repository or do whatever you want.
